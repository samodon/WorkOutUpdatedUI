## Development Details

Cyber-Gym's development involved innovative methods for data acquisition and animation. A significant portion of the data used in the AI algorithms was acquired synthetically using Blender, a powerful 3D creation suite. This approach allowed for a diverse and comprehensive dataset, essential for the accurate tracking of workout activities.

Additionally, Adobe Mixamo was instrumental in providing high-quality animations and character rigs, which greatly enhanced the development process and the overall user experience of the app.
